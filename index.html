        My plan is to create a site highlighting all of my favorite places I've been. I'll focus on my favorite seven places: SF, NYC, Mangalore, Mumbai, South Bay, Carmel/Monterey, & Pinecrest. I think it'll be nice to visualize my life. The first page will be a map and then the viewer can either go back to the home page map, or click to go to the next page (more like a zine). I kind of want to add a caption for the images. The colors on this project will be on the brighter side, a lot of the photos I have taken in these places are of nature, and warm, so I want the colors and fonts to reflect that. I want the site to feel comfortable and welcoming.
