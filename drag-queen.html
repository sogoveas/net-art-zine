            Drag makeup refers to the style of makeup used by drag performers to create bold, expressive, and often theatrical looks. It emphasizes features such as the eyes, lips, jawline, and cheekbones through techniques like contouring, bold eyeshadows, and dramatic lashes. More than just cosmetic artistry, drag makeup is a form of self-expression. Often used in a way to transform oneself, and explore gender expression while amplifying performance and self-presentation.

            Willow Pill is known for her surreal, whimsical approach to drag, blending softness with dark humor. In her Drag Race finale look—her iconic “I Hate People” outfit—she appeared in an oversized pink mushroom-inspired garment with matching makeup that exaggerated round, doll-like eyes, pastel blush, and a softly blurred lip. The look balanced cuteness with discomfort, using makeup to heighten the uncanny, sickly-sweet persona central to her drag. Her finale presentation emphasized how drag makeup can create characters that are emotionally complex, ironic, and deeply personal.
